# Tools
Collection of MaxMSP Patchers to consolidate common functions

## How to use
At the moment I have yet to find a clean way to load patches into bpatchers without at least some intervention.
Indication of when to use a tool in a patcher is given in any relevant sketch as well as an outline of how they should be hooked up to the sketch.

## `set_serial`
use with bpatcher to have a simple way of populating available serial ports as well as selecting and setting up a serial device.
